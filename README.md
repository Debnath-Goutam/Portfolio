##### Objective
This project's primary objective is to analyze the Consumer Price Index (CPI) across different Indian states from 2011 to 2023. The analysis will uncover regional inflation variations and long-term trends, providing a nuanced understanding of India's diverse economic conditions. These insights will contribute to economic policy discussions and aid in policy-making and economic forecasting. The project acknowledges that state-wise analysis can offer targeted insights for policy interventions, and aims to enhance our understanding of inflation in India, promoting strategies for managing inflation and economic stability.
##### Methodology
In this project, we've used Python libraries - Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. We've employed Pandas for its powerful data structures to efficiently handle and analyze the CPI data. Matplotlib and Seaborn have been used to create meaningful visualizations such as time series plots to identify trends over time, and comparative plots to understand the differences in CPI across states. These tools have enabled us to interpret the data effectively and draw insightful conclusions about the state-wise Consumer Price Index in India from 2011 to 2023.
##### Significance
The analysis provides valuable insights into the economic conditions in different states, as reflected by the CPI. It can help policymakers, economists, and researchers in understanding the inflationary trends in India and formulating appropriate economic policies.
